# RetroGB
-------------

RetroGB is a C++ based Nintendo Gameboy Emulator, that currently only runs on Windows although LibRetroGB should be platform independent. It's goal is readability and hopefully good accuracy.

#### Compiling under Windows: 
 - You need Visual Studio 2015
 - Open RetroGB.sln inside the ```Platforms/Windows/RetroGB``` folder
 - Hit build
